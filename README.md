## Explanation of this repo

This repo is meant to be a comforting message to anyone who feels similarly to how I did.

In my early twenties I began seeking professional help from therapists, and psychiatrists. And, doing so was very helpful. But, one thing they never could provide me was that I wanted to hear from someone who felt the same way as I did. There were a lot of ideas in my head, and I would speak to therapists about them, but I never truly felt like they understood me. I would explain to them how horrible living was, but they never would concede any truth, it always was about fixing the issue. I think it is important to validate the reality of how bleak life can be when viewed with a cynical lens. But, then go on to show them the impact of one's decisions in life. Because yes, life can seem bleak, but it is the cynical lens they see the world through that puts all the good out of focus.

For example, starting a task is usually met with desires to procrastinate or some feeling of anxiety. If the initial suffering is all someone sees, then it is resonable for them to not feel well. This is illustrated by two different mindsets. Is every task that needs done visually represented by the same singular mountain, that continues to grow in height, and is never ending suffering. Or is every task broken up into individual mountains, and at the end of each task there is excitement and fun.

I want to give more info on what I mean by "trying to talk to people about how I felt". I had pervasive suicidal ideation gnawing at the back of mind. I felt life had no meaning, and I felt numb. I recall frequent bouts of what I described as "paralysis". During college, I would sit down at the computer to do an assignment, just to suddenly find myself overwhelmed with such a strong sense of sadness that I was unable to move. I was fully cognizant, and if someone were to come at me trying to harm me, I imagine I would react. And yet, I couldn't move my body. If I fought hard, I could just barely get my hands on my keyboard. Yet each keypress was too heavy for me to muster the strength to press. Eventually, I found myself intellectualizing the situation. I would tell my therapist that it was philosophically correct to commit suicide. And that I had no meaning in my life, no hope, I felt physically weak. After I explained these things I'd just be given another appointment to come back next month. I explained to my psychiatrist this obsession I had "that it was philosophically correct to commit suicide". I didn't want to exist. They diagnosed me as schizoaffective, and prescribed me an anti-psychotic, Risperidone.

The antipsychotics helped stabilize my emotions, and slow down racing thoughts / anxiety, but I could not shake the obsession with getting an explanation for why I should continue to live. Below, I had linked to the song [Daughter - Medicine lyrics](https://youtu.be/sf6mkYz4mx0?si=inJgplfZ8NJF_BuO). I deliberated a lot prior to adding the song link. One line of the lyrics is: "you've got a beautiful brain but its disintegrated from all the medicine." This is how I felt while I was on antipsychotics. But, I want to make it clear that one should listen to their psychiatrist or therapist. They are trained, and want to help you. I had been on pill form antipsychotics, and monthly injectables, for about a year at one point. Yet, I think my brain is working fine, it doesn't seem to have disintegrated.  The antipsychotics can help stabilize you, and if you want to stop taking them because of the dreariness they cause, then work with your psychiatrist / therapist, to come up with a plan.

In this repo, I want to try and respond to my younger self. Because professional treatment was helpful, but it doesn't scratch the same itch as seeing someone else who used to share your thoughts, but no longer feels that way. I was fixated on the "bad" of life. I wanted to intellectualize the "bad" away. But the reality is, the "bad" of life isn't going anywhere, and that is okay. Instead of intellectualizing away the "bad", these days I focus on the enjoyment of anything life throws at me. If I embrace life, whether it be a bad situation, or a good situation, so long as I make the most of it, it somehow is enjoyable. It is like a story. Stories don't only have positive uplifting scenes in them. The excitement and enjoyment of life doesn't come from the "good", nor the "bad". It comes from the fluctuation between the two states, and the excitement that stems from not knowing how the future will turn out.

For this reason, I don't like "The Myth of Sisyphus". I believe it focuses too much on the concept of "good" and "bad" situations in life. I don't think life is so black and white. One doesn't go from disliking the act of rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity, to suddenly liking it. Instead, my belief is that rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity sucks, but breaking down the act into stages illustrates the fluctuation in mood, and that embracing moods beyond "happy" as a good thing, is key. It isn't about being "happy". When one starts rolling the boulder up the hill, there is inertia, and then with time muscles will be engorged with blood due to heavy lifting, this feeling of strength ends up being an exhilarating feeling. And as the boulder gets closer to the top of the hill, one's will to continue the task to completion drastically increases, to the point of the task becoming effortless, like one is floating, once the boulder reaches the top, one can feel fullfillment, then as the gods force the boulder to roll back down the hill, one can descend the hill themselves back to the bottom, all the while enjoying the "runners high" that came from the physical exertion of pushing the boulder. They are then met again with a "bad" situation, which is the inertia of the boulder needing to start moving again. But somehow, this fluctuation between the states is what makes it enjoyable, not that the situation itself is innately enjoyable or not.

I want talk about drug abuse for a moment. I only ever was interested in amphetamine. For me it was a way to get out of my "paralysis". But, some of my most suicidal moments in life, have been while high on amphetamine. This is something that fascinates me. I'm not referring to the "comedown" of drug usage. I mean to say, manic mood, pleasureable sensation, yet with racing suicidal ideation. I think this all ties back to the recurring theme of what I'm saying, life is about the fluctuation between moods. No one situation is innately enjoyable. I haven't had any amphetamine during the time of me working on this IDE. And, I love it this way. Some days while I am working, I am grappling with the code. And other days, I've just had a realization about the code and I'm on cloud 9. Programming is not innately an enjoyable experience. It evokes all possible moods, based on the situation at hand. And the fact that it isn't purely pleasurable, is exactly what makes it so enjoyable. If anything in this repo comes across as though I'm trying to make drug abuse "cool", it isn't my intention. I think it is necessary to approach someone who is stuck in drug abuse, with understanding and empathy. For that reason, much of the videos I watched while I wasn't feeling well, I've included a link to in this repo.

These days I happen to have fallen in love with an IDE. But it isn't about making an IDE. If one just finds something to fight for, it makes any experience in life more bearable. Because now you aren't just trudging through life, but moving with determination. I mentioned how I don't like the idea of "good" or "bad" things in life. As well, if one finds themselves obsessed with finding meaning in life. I myself find it best to accept that there is no grand meaning in life, but that it doesn't matter anyhow. I'm free to do what I want, knowing there isn't anything else I need be doing to fullfill the grand meaning. If you want to spend 12 hours programming an IDE, or spend 12 hours watching TV, earth won't suddenly fall out of alignment because of your decision.

## Background Information

I want to start off by giving some background information on myself.

I am 24 years old, dropped out of college, live with my parents, and am unemployed. (2023-06-01)

The previous information I stated is important to understanding my motives. Perhaps you'd think of me as an angst ridden fool after reading that short bit of information.

Well, that is probably accurate.

## Existential Dread

I obsess over trying to find a reason to get out of bed in the morning.

To me, life is meaningless. And so, if one is to hold such a belief, how do they withstand the frequent suffering in life?

I spend most of my day fighting the urge to slump to the floor and completely go limp. Where might I find strength to resist the weight of this sadness that perpetually pulls me down.

I've searched for the answer in many places.

Perhaps it makes most sense to start with some movies that I enjoy greatly.

I'll start with the movie titled: ["Stalker" (1979 film | Wikipedia link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film)).

The film takes place in an unnamed and seemingly war-torn area. The film focuses on a mysterious restricted site known as the "Zone", where there supposedly exists a room which grants a person's innermost desires.

Travelling to the "Zone" is dangerous. Anyone who wishes to go brings along a "Stalker", who is to act as a guide.

The film tells the story of an expedition led by a "Stalker", and his two clients. The two clients of which are: a melancholic writer seeking inspiration, and a professor seeking scientific discovery.

A main theme in the film is the idea of faith. Some individuals in the war-torn area hold faith they can have a better life by way of the "Zone". The "Stalker" in this film belives faith is needed to live a good life.

I see this film as describing "teleological faith". Where "teleological" is relating to or involving the explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.

A contemporary example of "teleological faith" could be a depressed individual engaging in a religion, not because they truly believe, but because they find it makes them a happier person.

If I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, perhaps going to church events with others would provide some motivation.

I don't enjoy the idea of "teleological faith" personally. I continued reading, and watching films.

I read about the philosophy of "Absurdism". Where "Absurdism" is to mean:

> "a philosophy based on the belief that the universe is irrational and meaningless and that the search for order brings the individual into conflict with the universe."

A large part of "Absurdism" is shown in a book titled: "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus.

"The Myth of Sisyphus" is about a king named, "Sisyphus" who was condemned by the gods to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down every time it neared the top. This would repeat for eternity.

The writer of the book, Albert Camus, wondered how Sisyphus could persist through this state of perpetual suffering. Albert Camus decided, "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

So, how might one apply "The Myth of Sisyphus" today? The most obvious example would likely be a job. One gets up for work on the weekdays, just to do it again the next week.

I find some degree of fault in the idea that "One must imagine Sisyphus happy." For example, if you do not enjoy living, how do you start enjoying it? Albert Camus as well says, "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart." when referring to Sisyphus. Again I find myself thinking, what about if it doesn't stir my heart?

The next movie I'd like to bring up is titled: ["Trainspotting" (1996 film | Wikipedia link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainspotting_(film)).

The movie is about a group of heroin addicts in an economically depressed area of Edinburgh.

As I had said regarding "The Myth of Sisyphus", what do I do when life doesn't "stir my heart"? Perhaps one might use drugs in this case.

The film opens with the following quote:

> “Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television. Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats that you've spawned to replace yourself, choose your future. Choose life. But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose life. I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin.”

The quote is a play on an anti-drug campaign which told people to "Choose life". 

The main character named "Renton", lists out all the benefits you get from choosing life. Each benefit he lists though is said with sarcasm.

I like the opening to this film a lot. The general idea is something I relate with. Life does not excite me. Life does not interested me. There is a saying that drug abusers are, "throwing their lives away". I find this quote to be Renton agreeing that he is throwing his life away. But that he never wanted that life in the first place.

And so, where can I find something in life that makes me happy?

I find myself pursuing a "psychologically rich life". That is to say, a life characterized by a variety of interesting and perspective-changing experiences. [APA review on the topic](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rev-rev0000317.pdf)

While working on the ["Luthetus.Ide" (github)](https://github.com/Luthetus/Luthetus.Ide) I believe I've found exactly that.

I thought I was a good programmer until I started writing ["Luthetus.Ide" (github)](https://github.com/Luthetus/Luthetus.Ide). The extent of what I do not understand is awe inspiring. I look forward to everyday, because there is a vast amount I want to explore. The struggle of learning a concept you do not understand, the anticipation as you begin to understand, the great satisfaction of then getting your code to work. I live for this.
