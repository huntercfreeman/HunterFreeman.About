## Explanation of this repo

This repo is meant to be a comforting message to anyone who feels similarly to how I did.

In my early twenties I began seeking professional help from therapists, and psychiatrists. And, doing so was very helpful. But, one thing they never could provide me was that I wanted to hear from someone who felt the same way as I did. There were a lot of ideas in my head, and I would speak to therapists about them, but I never truly felt like they understood me. I would explain to them how horrible living was, but they never would concede any truth. I think it is important to validate the reality of how bleak life can be when viewed with a cynical lens. But, then go on to show them the impact of one's decisions in life. Because yes, life can seem bleak, but it is the cynical lens they see the world through that puts all the good out of focus.

For example, starting a task is usually met with desires to procrastinate or some feeling of anxiety. If the initial suffering is all someone sees, then it is resonable for them to not feel well. This is illustrated by two different mindsets. Is every task that needs done visually represented by the same singular mountain, that continues to grow in height, and is never ending suffering. Or is every task broken up into individual mountains, and at the end of each task there is excitement and fun.

I want to give more info about how I felt. I had pervasive suicidal ideation gnawing at the back of mind. I felt life had no meaning, and I felt numb. I recall frequent bouts of what I described as "paralysis". During college, I would sit down at the computer to do an assignment, just to suddenly find myself overwhelmed with such a strong sense of sadness that I was unable to move. I was fully cognizant, and if someone were to come at me trying to harm me, I imagine I would react. And yet, I couldn't move my body. If I fought hard, I could just barely get my hands on my keyboard. Yet each keypress was too heavy for me to muster the strength to press. Eventually, I found myself intellectualizing the situation. I would tell my therapist that it was philosophically correct to commit suicide. And that I had no meaning in my life, no hope, I felt physically weak. After I explained these things, they would try fixing the issue, and I'd just be given another appointment to come back next month. All I wanted was the therapist to say, "yeah that does suck, but its okay, stop fixating on the bad things and find what you enjoy". I explained to my psychiatrist this obsession I had "that it was philosophically correct to commit suicide". I didn't want to exist. They diagnosed me as schizoaffective, and prescribed me an anti-psychotic, Risperidone.

The antipsychotics helped stabilize my emotions, and slow down racing thoughts / anxiety, but I could not shake the obsession with getting an explanation for why I should continue to live. Below, I had linked to the song [Daughter - Medicine lyrics](https://youtu.be/sf6mkYz4mx0?si=inJgplfZ8NJF_BuO). I deliberated a lot prior to adding the song link. One line of the lyrics is: "you've got a beautiful brain but it's disintegrated from all the medicine." This is how I felt while I was on antipsychotics. But, I want to make it clear that one should listen to their psychiatrist or therapist. They are trained, and want to help you. I had been on pill form antipsychotics, and monthly injectables, for about a year at one point. Yet, I think my brain is working fine, it doesn't seem to have disintegrated.  The antipsychotics can help stabilize you, and if you want to stop taking them because of the dullness they cause, then work with your psychiatrist / therapist, to come up with a plan.

I want to give more information about what I mean when I say therapists would, "try fixing the issue". I would desperately try to explain to them that suicide was the answer to life. That one should aim to die as soon as possible, in order to escape the perpetual suffering of life. A common response I would get was, "and then what". Literally that phrase as I quoted it, was the most common response. And, I am not upset with them for saying this, if someone frantically was explaining to me that the meaning of life was suicide, I don't even think I'd have a response if I were in the therapist's shoes. Back in the day, when I got this response, I usually didn't say anything because I didn't want to push the issue and end up involuntarily in a psych ward. But in my head I'd think, "What do you mean and then what? I just told you, the suffering would be over." This exact scenario I'm describing is extremely frustrating as the patient. It feels as though they are questioning your ability to reason. Some of my motivation for working on the IDE was out of spite. That I would show everyone how well I can reason through and solve problems. That by showcasing competency in programming, it would validate my beliefs. But, in this scenario, the patient is delusional. I am not a therapist, but I think it is important to validate with the patient, that given their delusional outlook on life, what they believe is a logical conclusion. These individuals can be extremely skilled, and "intelligent". It is more so, that for some reason, something in their brain broke. I imagine that it was some trauma they experienced, that caused their brain to break in a way. This "brain break" is what brought about their delusional world view. And as more and more time passes, they solidify their beliefs in this delusional world. Saying "and then what" as a response does not go anywhere. These people see life as solely suferring, their goal in life, is to die. The world they live in is nothing like what the therapist is seeing. A common situation with the patient's mindset is that life is just the chemicals in their brain. This is again, a delusional thought, that I had, and desperately tried to have others affirm. If you think this, consider if you were strapped to a chair, in a padded cell, and an IV of some dopaminergic drug was pumped into your system. This would likely be a torturous scenario, because you do care about the experiences you have in life. There is more to living than just feelings of pleasure.

I put the word, "intelligent", in quotes in the previous paragraph. I did this because I hate the word, and all of its synonyms. I believe you either can learn things, or you cannot. At that point, anything you don't understand, is because you chose not to understand it, and that is okay. There are only so many hours in a day, we have to pick and choose what knowledge we accumulate. I am a terrible writer, as you can tell by reading anything I've written. The reason I'm a terrible writer however, is because I chose to obsess over programming, and in the process neglected practicing my writing skills.

In this repo, I want to try and respond to my younger self. Because professional treatment was helpful, but it doesn't scratch the same itch as seeing someone else who used to share your thoughts, but no longer feels that way. I was fixated on the "bad" of life. I wanted to intellectualize the "bad" away. But the reality is, the "bad" of life isn't going anywhere, and that is okay. Instead of intellectualizing away the "bad", these days I focus on the enjoyment of anything life throws at me. If I embrace life, whether it be a bad situation, or a good situation, so long as I make the most of it, it somehow is enjoyable. It is like a story. Stories don't only have positive uplifting scenes in them. The excitement and enjoyment of life doesn't come from the "good", nor the "bad". It comes from the fluctuation between the two states, and the excitement that stems from not knowing how the future will turn out.

For this reason, I don't like "The Myth of Sisyphus". I believe it focuses too much on the concept of "good" and "bad" situations in life. I don't think life is so black and white. One doesn't go from disliking the act of rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity, to suddenly liking it. Instead, my belief is that rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity sucks, but breaking down the act into stages illustrates the fluctuation in mood, and that embracing moods beyond "happy" as a good thing, is key. It isn't about being "happy". When one starts rolling the boulder up the hill, there is inertia, and then with time muscles will be engorged with blood due to heavy lifting, this feeling of strength ends up being an exhilarating feeling. And as the boulder gets closer to the top of the hill, one's will to continue the task to completion drastically increases, to the point of the task becoming effortless, like one is floating, once the boulder reaches the top, one can feel fullfillment, then as the gods force the boulder to roll back down the hill, one can descend the hill themselves back to the bottom, all the while enjoying the "runners high" that came from the physical exertion of pushing the boulder. They are then met again with a "bad" situation, which is the inertia of the boulder needing to start moving again. But somehow, this fluctuation between the states is what makes it enjoyable, not that the situation itself is innately enjoyable or not.

I want talk about drug abuse for a moment. I only ever was interested in amphetamine. For me it was a way to get out of my "paralysis". But, some of my most suicidal moments in life, have been while high on amphetamine. This is something that fascinates me. I'm not referring to the "comedown" of drug usage. I mean to say, manic mood, pleasureable sensation, yet with racing suicidal ideation. I think this all ties back to the recurring theme of what I'm saying, life is about the fluctuation between moods. No one situation is innately enjoyable. I haven't had any amphetamine during the time of me working on this IDE. And, I love it this way. Some days while I am working, I am grappling with the code. And other days, I've just had a realization about the code and I'm on cloud 9. Programming is not innately an enjoyable experience. It evokes all possible moods, based on the situation at hand. And the fact that it isn't purely pleasurable, is exactly what makes it so enjoyable. If anything in this repo comes across as though I'm trying to make drug abuse "cool", it isn't my intention. I think it is necessary to approach someone who is stuck in drug abuse, with understanding and empathy. For that reason, much of the videos I watched while I wasn't feeling well, I've included a link to in this repo. (I only linked youtube videos, and gave thought to the content of the video. The video for "APATI - Kemisk Karlek" is a bit graphic in terms of movie-scene drug usage, but it was age restricted on youtube, so I figure that would act as an appropriate blocking factor).

These days I happen to have fallen in love with an IDE. But it isn't about making an IDE. If one just finds something to fight for, it makes any experience in life more bearable. Because now you aren't just trudging through life, but moving with determination. I mentioned how I don't like the idea of "good" or "bad" things in life. As well, if one finds themselves obsessed with finding meaning in life. I myself find it best to accept that there is no grand meaning in life, but that it doesn't matter anyhow. I'm free to do what I want, knowing there isn't anything else I need be doing to fullfill the grand meaning. If you want to spend 12 hours programming an IDE, or spend 12 hours watching TV, earth won't suddenly fall out of alignment because of your decision.

## Background Information

I want to start off by giving some background information on myself.

I am 24 years old, dropped out of college, live with my parents, and am unemployed. (2023-06-01)

The previous information I stated is important to understanding my motives. Perhaps you'd think of me as an angst ridden fool after reading that short bit of information.

Well, that is probably accurate.

## Existential Dread

I obsess over trying to find a reason to get out of bed in the morning.

To me, life is meaningless. And so, if one is to hold such a belief, how do they withstand the frequent suffering in life?

I spend most of my day fighting the urge to slump to the floor and completely go limp. Where might I find strength to resist the weight of this sadness that perpetually pulls me down.

I've searched for the answer in many places.

Perhaps it makes most sense to start with some movies that I enjoy greatly.

I'll start with the movie titled: ["Stalker" (1979 film | Wikipedia link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film)).

The film takes place in an unnamed and seemingly war-torn area. The film focuses on a mysterious restricted site known as the "Zone", where there supposedly exists a room which grants a person's innermost desires.

Travelling to the "Zone" is dangerous. Anyone who wishes to go brings along a "Stalker", who is to act as a guide.

The film tells the story of an expedition led by a "Stalker", and his two clients. The two clients of which are: a melancholic writer seeking inspiration, and a professor seeking scientific discovery.

A main theme in the film is the idea of faith. Some individuals in the war-torn area hold faith they can have a better life by way of the "Zone". The "Stalker" in this film belives faith is needed to live a good life.

I see this film as describing "teleological faith". Where "teleological" is relating to or involving the explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.

A contemporary example of "teleological faith" could be a depressed individual engaging in a religion, not because they truly believe, but because they find it makes them a happier person.

If I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, perhaps going to church events with others would provide some motivation.

I don't enjoy the idea of "teleological faith" personally. I continued reading, and watching films.

I read about the philosophy of "Absurdism". Where "Absurdism" is to mean:

> "a philosophy based on the belief that the universe is irrational and meaningless and that the search for order brings the individual into conflict with the universe."

A large part of "Absurdism" is shown in a book titled: "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus.

"The Myth of Sisyphus" is about a king named, "Sisyphus" who was condemned by the gods to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down every time it neared the top. This would repeat for eternity.

The writer of the book, Albert Camus, wondered how Sisyphus could persist through this state of perpetual suffering. Albert Camus decided, "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

So, how might one apply "The Myth of Sisyphus" today? The most obvious example would likely be a job. One gets up for work on the weekdays, just to do it again the next week.

I find some degree of fault in the idea that "One must imagine Sisyphus happy." For example, if you do not enjoy living, how do you start enjoying it? Albert Camus as well says, "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart." when referring to Sisyphus. Again I find myself thinking, what about if it doesn't stir my heart?

The next movie I'd like to bring up is titled: ["Trainspotting" (1996 film | Wikipedia link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainspotting_(film)).

The movie is about a group of heroin addicts in an economically depressed area of Edinburgh.

As I had said regarding "The Myth of Sisyphus", what do I do when life doesn't "stir my heart"? Perhaps one might use drugs in this case.

The film opens with the following quote:

> “Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television. Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats that you've spawned to replace yourself, choose your future. Choose life. But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose life. I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin.”

The quote is a play on an anti-drug campaign which told people to "Choose life". 

The main character named "Renton", lists out all the benefits you get from choosing life. Each benefit he lists though is said with sarcasm.

I like the opening to this film a lot. The general idea is something I relate with. Life does not excite me. Life does not interested me. There is a saying that drug abusers are, "throwing their lives away". I find this quote to be Renton agreeing that he is throwing his life away. But that he never wanted that life in the first place.

And so, where can I find something in life that makes me happy?

I find myself pursuing a "psychologically rich life". That is to say, a life characterized by a variety of interesting and perspective-changing experiences. [APA review on the topic](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rev-rev0000317.pdf)

While working on the ["Luthetus.Ide" (github)](https://github.com/Luthetus/Luthetus.Ide) I believe I've found exactly that.

I thought I was a good programmer until I started writing ["Luthetus.Ide" (github)](https://github.com/Luthetus/Luthetus.Ide). The extent of what I do not understand is awe inspiring. I look forward to everyday, because there is a vast amount I want to explore. The struggle of learning a concept you do not understand, the anticipation as you begin to understand, the great satisfaction of then getting your code to work. I live for this.

## Synchronization Context, what is it?:

In the video I showcase that I have 0 idea what a synchronization context is,
nor what .ConfigureAwait(false) is.

So I'll link to the timestamp of the video, and given that a year or 2 have passed, I'll provide my current
understanding of what a synchronization context is, perhaps I am correct perhaps I am not.

https://www.youtube.com/live/tOHihL9Lf7Y?si=uzK0sz8RBw0JAYNq&t=3656

Synchronization Context starts with the concept of a concurrent programming model.

A concurrent programming model can be implemented in a few various ways.

- 1: multiple processors, which allow multiple tasks to be then ran in parallel.

- 2: Single processor and an 'async await' way of executing tasks.
- 2a: This 'async await' can through a single processor, run many tasks (seemingly-parallel to a user)
by using a state machine, to determine which task takes control of the processor whenever
an 'await' is hit in the code.
- 2b: The most ubiquitous example to me would be awating an HTTP request. The processor doesn't need
to do anything during this time, so some other task can be given the opportunity to run.

- 3: Multiple processors, and 'async await'.

But, the issue with concurrent programming models, is locking state, so that it doesn't change out from under you
due to a different task having mutated its state.

So, a language native implementation of 'locking state' is with the synchronization context.

You can attach to a task a synchronization context, and then in code you can check what the
current synchronization context is. Maybe it is 'Thread.SynchronizationContext'.

So, the UI thread, is in reality just the Task that was assigned the UI Synchronization Context.

If you want to modify some state that is locked to a certain Synchronization Context, then you must
Dispatch your 'action' or 'Func&lt;Task&gt;' etc... to that Task who has control of the Synchronization Context.

Therefore, in Blazor we write 'await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);' for example.

- 'await SomeMethodAsync.ConfigureAwait(false)' this is done in order to relinquish control of the synchronization
context, so that it may be used elsewhere. I think the common example is in Blazor WASM apps where this is most often seen an issue.
This is due to the single threaded runtime of WASM at the moment. So, if you neglect to add '.ConfigureAwait(false)', you can
take control of the UI Synchronization Context while awaiting an HTTP response, and block the UI from updating for the entirety
of that await. Because although you did an 'await' the UI can't get access to the synchronization context because you're hogging it.

I think I said that Photino was single threaded, I don't think I was correct there.

I randomly decided to type this up before going to bed because the idea pop'd into my mind. I might come back to this text and clean it up later.
I read this back and it has the energy of the "Feeling cute might delete later" meme.

## BIS (best in slot) keyboard and mouse
- https://www.amazon.com/Rii-RKM709-Gigahertz-Ultra-Slim-Multimedia/dp/B0CNSNTR8S/
$19 compact keyboard with mouse that has back and forwards side buttons -- wireless dongle
I use this bad boy. Pref would be wired so no batteries. Can swap out the mouse for a wired one
to save batteries, but the keyboard is irreplaceable. I think this is better
than any keyboard out there, it isn't only about low cost, it also is simply the best.
I use this keyboard even when I play a videogame on my computer.

It has a "turn off computer" button and I can't stand when keyboards have these.
But, you can disable it by changing what the computer does when you hit the power button.
I then make sure to test it randomly to make sure it isn't going to turn off my computer
if I accidentally hit it instead of the volume buttons that are RIGHT NEXT TO IT?!?!?!??!!!!!

## I Am a Bad Programmer
- I am a bad programmer, but I am aware of my faults. I actively think about the process of thinking itself, in order to optimize my ability to problem solve. I am certain to reflect on experiences. And that a good outcome does not necessarily equate to a good decision; the same holds true for bad outcomes. Through this metacognition and self reflection, I can grow beyond my faults and learn things that initially horrify me with their complexity.
- Consistency is extremely important. I believe sleep to be the key to learning. But, if you don't challenge yourself one day, then that night of sleep has nothing to grow from. For this reason I program daily. Even if you aren't feeling well, and it is just 1 hour, it is extremely productive to do that 1 hour.
- Exercise has a massive impact on my ability to focus. I tend to go for a 1 hour walk every day. I sometimes want to do more, but just be wary of consistency. Don't "weekend warrior" it, then spend a week doing nothing.
- I avoid excess caffeine. I enjoy my fair share of caffeine, but I make sure it doesn't mess with my sleep. Sleep is extremely important to me. I plan how I will find time to sleep, and preferably I lay in the bed 8 to 9 hours from when I'm going to wake up.
- I have never drank alcohol, and I never smoked marijuana or anything nicotine related. Furthermore, I never intend to consume them in the future. I am sharing this info in order to more clearly show who I am. Because, the Clips section of this repo showcases a lot of "drug" related videos. My feelings about this topic is more nuanced than what might be presumed by someone who glances at this repository. If I ever find time to write about it maybe I will, but this is at the least a brief clarification for now.
- In the "Background Information" section I said that I: "dropped out of college, live with my parents, and am unemployed". Please do NOT follow my path. When I hear a song brag about dropping out of college I cringe immensely. I mentioned those things because it paints a picture of who I am. Do NOT follow in my footsteps.
